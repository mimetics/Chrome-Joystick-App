Chrome-Joystick-App
===================

Chrome App that shows the type and current control and button values for Joysticks.  

This app uses the "navigator.getGamepads" API - to make the application recognize a Joystick/Gamepad, plug it into the PC where this App is running and then press any of the "X", "Y", "Box" or "Triangle" buttons on the gamepad or press the trigger on the Joystick.  

X-Box Gamepads, Logitech F310 Gamepads have been tested with this App as well as Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick.
